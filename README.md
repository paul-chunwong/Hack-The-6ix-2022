# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Hack-The-6ix




üåç Background
Unlike the traditional profit-orientated approach in financial investing, responsible investing is a relatively new concept that expressly recognizes the importance of environmental, social, and governance aspects to the investor and the long-term health and stability of the market (Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, 2021). However, currently, ESG does not have a standardized evaluation system that allows investors to quickly determine the potential of the financial products.

‚ù£Ô∏è Inspiration
More recently, some have claimed that ESG standards, in addition to their social value, might protect investors from the crises that arise when businesses that operate in a hazardous or immoral manner are finally held responsible for their effects. Examples include the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil disaster by BP and the billion-dollar emissions scandal at Volkswagen, which both had a negative impact on the stock values of their respective corporations. (Investopedia, 2022). Therefore, the demand of creating an easy-to-use ESG evolution tool for everybody is essential to address the stigma that investing, saving, and budgeting are only for privileged populations.

‚öôÔ∏è Solution
Inspired by the current uncertainty about ESG evaluation methods, our team proposed and implemented an online ESG evaluation platform with our recently developed algorithms called Stock Stalker that allow investors to search, manage, and see the overall ESG performance of the selected stocks associated with a built-in recommendation system.

To See. To Learn. To Apply. To Earn. To Contribute. Stock Stalker redefines what it means to earn profits while ensuring the investment is making positive impacts on the environment, society, and governance. Using React, REST API, and our developed algorithms, Stock Stalker offers investors both access to real-time financial data including the ESG rating of the stocks, and a platform that illustrates the ESG properties of the store without providing those hard-to-understand technical details. After using our product, the investor can have a deeper understanding of ESG investments without the need to learn about professional finance knowledge. As a result, these investors are now able to make accurate ESG investments based on their interests.

üóùÔ∏è Key Product Features
¬∑Allow users to search and save the selected stocks based on the input of stock symbols. ¬∑Access to real-time financial data such as the Earning Per Share (EPS) and the current stock price trend. ¬∑Provide numerical ESG ratings in different aspects with our developed algorithms. ¬∑Illustrate ESG properties of the stocks through an easy-to-understand recommendations system.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
¬∑The prototype was designed with Figma while the front end was built on React ¬∑We used Tailwind CSS, framer-motion and various libraries to decorate our web page ¬∑The backend data was stored on JSON-Server, cors and axios ¬∑Notifications are sent out using Twilio ¬∑Functionalities were built with tradingviewwidget

üî• What we're proud of
Even though we faced difficulties in the back-end implementation, we still figured out the techniques that are required for our site via collaboration. Another accomplishment is that our team members not only learned the programming techniques but also, we learned so much finance knowledge during the hack. Additionally, given that we were primarily a front-end team with no experience in dealing with the back-end, we are incredibly proud that we were able to take up the new concepts in very little time (big thanks to the mentors as well!).

üî≠ What's Next for Stock Stalker
Looking to the future for Stock Stalker, we intend on implementing functions that connect our ESG evaluation site to the actual stock-buying organizations. Further implementation includes an additional page that provides the estimated price of the stock selected from the site with the buying options from different stock buying platforms so that the investors can compare and purchase the stock in a more convenient way.
